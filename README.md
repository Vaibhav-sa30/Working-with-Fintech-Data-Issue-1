# Working with Fintech Data Issue #1

### Problem Statement

- **Credit Marketing** -- Whom to target as new customer?
- **Credit Risk** -- How do we decide credit scoring and appraisal?

Following data from Shop.Happy is provided to us:
 
1. Credit data: Data about credit applications, approved/declined decisions, repayment details, and more at the customer level.

2. Marketing data: Transaction level data with details like merchant industry, price, chosen funding instrument, and more. 

3. AB Testing data: AB testing data for 3 months for transactions with random recommendation (nudge) of Funding Instrument as default (control group) and data-based recommendation (nudge) of Funding Instrument as default (test group). The test/control group tag for every transaction is provided.


## What is Nudge Economics?

Nudge economics a type of behavioral economics or choice architecture, that combines insights from psychology, economics, and behavioral science to understand how people make decisions. This designs intervention that guide or "nudge" individuals toward making better choices without mandating or restricting their options.

People's decisions can be influenced by the way choices are presented to them. And that's the central idea of nudge economics. People often exhibit irrational or suboptimal behaviors due to cognitive biases, limited information, or other psychological factors.

A/B testing to perform nudge in order to increase user engagement.

Consumer group is split into **TEST** and **CONTROL** group. 
Nudge is performed in test group

First we want to check the experiment is ran properly. Basically it shouldn't be a biased experiment.

To actually check that we want to know if the ratio of Average sum of transaction done on credit and debit card should be similar for **TEST** and **CONTROL** group.
